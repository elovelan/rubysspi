== 1.2.4
 * Compatibility updates for rubygems 1.2.0
 
== 1.2.2
 * Fixed incompatibility with RubyGems >= 0.9.2 and RubySSPI Net::HTTP patch. Patch now directly requires the SSPI files, rather than relying on RubyGems to load it.
 * Updated gem tests for compatibility with RubyGems >= 0.9.2.

== 1.2.0
 * Refactored naming in preparation for inclusion in ruby distribution
   * rubysspi.rb renamed to win32/sspi.rb
   * rubysspi/proxy_auth.rb renamed to win32/net/http_proxy_patch.rb
 * Updated apply_sspi_patch to determine if RubySSPI gem is installed and fail if not. Also fails if the patch has already been installed.
 * Added test to "test_patched_net_http.rb" to ensure net/http has been patched first.
 * Removed Win32 platform restriction on gem (though it will still only run in Win32 environments, real or emulated).
 * CHANGELOG begun
